# Fictional Train Route in Japan

https://kahfi.dev/showcase/fictional-train-route-in-japan/

## Decisions

- HTML,
- Plain CSS,
- Simple [CSS Reset](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/custom-css-reset/) from Josh W Comeau.
- If you know BEM convention, this [RSCSS](https://rstacruz.github.io/rscss/index.html) is another alternative that I use.
- Following Mark Otto (creator of Bootstrap) [standards](https://codeguide.co/) for the best of us!

## Approach

- Inkscape for creating SVGs
- Copy Japanese text using Google Translate

## How to Edit

1. Fork the repository.
2. You can use CLI commands to serve: `yarn start`.
3. or just double click index.html in file explorer or finder.
